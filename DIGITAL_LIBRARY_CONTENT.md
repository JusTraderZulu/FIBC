## About Us Content

### Who We Are

The Spiritual Baptist Faith and Spiritual Churches Digital Library (SBFSCDL) is the official digital archive and heritage center of the Faith International Baptist Convention Inc. Worldwide Fellowship (FIBCWF).

Established by Apostolic Decree and launched at the 19ᵗʰ Bi-Annual General Assembly, the Library serves as the sacred repository for the collective memory, doctrine, worship, and cultural expression of the Spiritual Baptist Faith and affiliated Spiritual Churches across the world.

It stands as a covenant between heritage and innovation — preserving the songs, prayers, decrees, and testimonies of our forebears while using 21ˢᵗ-century technology to make them accessible to future generations.

### Our Purpose

The Library exists to:

- Preserve the sacred records, liturgies, and oral histories that define the Faith.
- Protect documents, artifacts, and multimedia recordings from loss or misuse.
- Educate clergy, students, and scholars about the Apostolic and Cultural heritage of the Spiritual Baptist movement.
- Connect congregations across continents through a shared digital platform of remembrance.

Every image, hymn, and manuscript housed within the SBFSCDL is treated not merely as data, but as sacred testimony — a living echo of those who prayed, sang, and built before us.

### Our Mission

To preserve, protect, and promote the sacred, historical, and cultural legacy of the Spiritual Baptist Faith and the Spiritual Churches through systematic documentation, digitization, and education — ensuring accessibility to clergy, scholars, and believers under Apostolic authority.

### Our Vision

To be the world's leading Apostolic heritage institution, uniting faith, culture, and technology to ensure that the story of the Spiritual Baptist Faith will never again be lost, silenced, or forgotten.

### Our Oversight & Structure

The Library operates under the Office of the Executive Chairman, with direct Apostolic oversight by Apostolic Bishop Dr. W. B. Primus and the Apostolic and Patriarchal Household.

It functions collaboratively with the following Secretariats:

- **Secretariat for Ecclesiastical Heritage and Digital Archives (SEHDA)** – Administrative and archival operations.
- **Secretariat for ICT, AI, Cybersecurity and Digital Transformation (ICTAICDT)** – Digital infrastructure, innovation, and data security.
- **Secretariat for Apostolic Planning, Development and Protocol Management (PDPM)** – Strategic planning and ceremonial coordination.
- **Secretariat for General Assembly, Conference Management and Cultural Heritage Oversight (GACMCHO)** – Cultural presentations, exhibitions, and global conference management.

Its work is guided by a Board of Directors, a Board of Trustees, and a Commission for Ecclesiastical Archives and Sacred Heritage, ensuring transparency, doctrinal integrity, and cultural accuracy.

The Apostolic Custodian of the Sacred Archives, appointed by the Executive Chairman, serves as guardian of all physical and digital holdings.

### Our Core Values

Faithfulness · Integrity · Heritage · Education · Excellence · Unity in Diversity · Innovation

These values guide every upload, restoration, and exhibition — reminding us that technology is only as holy as the purpose it serves.

Exhibitions, symposiums, and musical tributes bring the Faith's story to life, ensuring that our heritage remains a living flame.
